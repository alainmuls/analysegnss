# Repository for analyzing GNSS Data

The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of tools to analyze GNSS data or to extract data from GNSS data in a reusable way. GNSS data can come from different sources, such as:
- GNSS raw data from a GNSS receiver (SBF or u-Blox raw data)
- GNSS data from a GNSS simulator
- GNSS data from NMEA sentences
- GNSS data coming from a RTCM server
- processed GNSS data from software (RTKLib or gLab)

Using classes for each data source and commonly used functions, the GNSS data can be analyzed or used in a way that is reusable.

## Description

The repository contains python scripts and python classes for analyzing GNSS data. The repository is organized as follows:
- `sbf`: contains the classes for reading and parsing SBF files
- `rtkpos`: contains the classes for reading and parsing the position and status files obtained by RTKLib processing
- `glab`: contains the classes for reading and parsing GLAB files (*not yet implemented*)

Each of these directories contain a python class for reading and parsing the data. The classes are designed to be used in a way that is reusable.

Next to these directories there is a `utils` directory which contains utility functions that can be used by python scripts or the classes. The `gnss` directory contains at present the `geoid` directory which is used to calculate the geoid height $H$ from the ellipsoid height $h$ and the geoid undulation $N$. The `plot` directory contains functions for plotting GNSS data.


The repository contains the following classes:
- `sbf/sbf_class`: class for reading and parsing SBF files
- `rtkpos/rtkpos_class`: class for reading and parsing the position and status files obtained by RTKLib processing
- `glab/glab_class`: class for reading and parsing the GLAB files (*not yet implemented*)

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
- What makes your project stand out?

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
